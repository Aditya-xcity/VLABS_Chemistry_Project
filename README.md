## Project Overview

The **Virtual Chemistry Lab (VLABS)** is an interactive educational tool that allows users to simulate basic chemical reactions digitally. It provides a **comprehensive element database**, validates possible reactions, identifies reaction types, and eventually can balance chemical equations. This project demonstrates how programming and chemistry can merge to create an accessible learning platform for students.

---

## Features

- Comprehensive **periodic table database** with element properties (symbol, name, atomic number, valence, common states).  
- **Reaction validation system**: checks whether two elements can react based on predefined rules.  
- **Reaction type identification** (synthesis, decomposition, combustion, etc.).  
- Interactive **frontend interface** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- **Flask backend APIs** that handle element/reaction queries efficiently.  
- Easily expandable and maintainable structure for future enhancements.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aditya-xcity/VLABS_Chemistry_Project.git
cd VLABS_Chemistry_Project
````

2. **Install required Python libraries**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(if `requirements.txt` is not present, install manually: `flask`, `flask-cors`, `pandas`)*

3. **Run the Flask server**:

```bash
python Backend/main.py
```

4. **Access the frontend**:
   Open a browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

---

## Usage

* Select elements from the dropdown menus.
* Click **React** to see if a chemical reaction occurs.
* View the resulting products and reaction type (if implemented).

---

## Future Enhancements

* Automatic **equation balancing**.
* Support for **multi-element reactions**.
* Improved **UI/UX with animations**.
* Detailed **chemical reaction reports** for educational purposes.
